# Week 2

In this week and the next, we shall properly start reinforcement learning, implement a few algorithms and train our agent to play some games.

## Assignment 1

Here, we will implement a few Bandit Algorithms such as the $\epsilon$-greedy policy, UCBA policy, gradient bandits and Thompson Sampling and 
use them to train an RL agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

Have a look at ```RL_tictactoe.py``` for detailed instructions.
